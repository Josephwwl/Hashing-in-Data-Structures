# Data-Structures
Implementation of hashing with collision solving using open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing) using Java.

# Prerequisites

 - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your computer.
 - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor to run the Java code.

## Running the Program

1. Clone or download the Problem 1 folder to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Choose the desired collision resolution test file and open it. (Example: LinearProbingTest.java)
4. Compile and run the file and follow the instructions in the terminal.
